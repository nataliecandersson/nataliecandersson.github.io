### During my time at UC Berkeley, I had the opportunity to work on several projects, within the IEOR department and outside of it.

#### Operations Management

- [Optimizing airline overselling using simulation optimization](https://github.com/nataliecandersson/nataliecandersson.github.io/blob/main/files/IEOR_174_Project_Report.pdf), with Lucie Chen and Varsha Nekkanti (advised by Professor Zeyu Zheng)
- [Applying decision analysis techniques to determine whether UC Berkeley can have in person instruction Fall 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e00QR-h2t6M), with Lucie Chen, Samantha Torres, and Jihee Choo


#### Other Interests
