# Welcome!

### I am currently an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR)](https://ieor.berkeley.edu). My research interests lie in matching markets and mechanism design for the public sector. I hope to pursue a Ph.D. in this field in the near future. 

#### My current research focuses on improving incentive compatibility for public housing authorities with Lucie Chen, Sophea Bonne, and Professor Zeyu Zheng.

#### I have also worked on several other projects that have guided me to my current interests:
- [Optimizing airline overselling using simulation optimization](https://github.com/nataliecandersson/nataliecandersson.github.io/blob/main/files/IEOR_174_Project_Report.pdf), with Lucie Chen and Varsha Nekkanti (advised by Professor Zeyu Zheng)
- Applying decision analysis techniques to determine whether UC Berkeley can have in person instruction Fall 2021, with Lucie Chen, Samantha Tito, and Jihee Choo
- Evaluating the accessibility of congressional websites with Connor Lin, Elif Citoglu (advised by Ph.D student Emma Lurie)

#### My coursework has centered around stochastic processes, simulation, mathematical programming (linear, integer, mixed-integer), revenue management, and supply chains.

#### I am also a grader for [IEOR 160](https://lavaei.ieor.berkeley.edu/Course_IEOR160_Spring_2022.html), a course on nonlinear and discrete optimization taught by Professor Javad Lavaei.  

#### Previosuly, I was a logistics systems engineering intern at [Zoox](https://zoox.com) for the summer of 2021 and a marketing analytics intern at [thredUP](https://thredup.com) for the summer of 2020.
