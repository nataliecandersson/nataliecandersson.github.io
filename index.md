&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ### Welcome!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ## I am currently a student UC Berkeley studying Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR) and Spanish. My research interests lie in matching markets and mechanism design for the public sector and I hope to pursue a Ph.D. in this field in the near future test. 



Move along.
