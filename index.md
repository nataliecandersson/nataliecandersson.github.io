# Welcome!

## I am currently a student UC Berkeley studying [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR)](ieor.berkeley.edu) and Spanish. My research interests lie in matching markets and mechanism design for the public sector. I hope to pursue a Ph.D. in this field in the near future. 


### I have had the privilege to work on a few different research projects during my time at UC Berkeley. 


- Current work: Improving incentive compatibility for public housing authorities with Lucie Chen, Sophea Bonne, and Professor Zeyu Zheng

- [Optimizing airline overselling using simulation optimization, with Lucie Chen and Varsha Nekkanti (advised by Professor Zeyu Zheng)](https://github.com/nataliecandersson/nataliecandersson.github.io/blob/main/files/IEOR_174_Project_Report.pdf)

- Applying decision analysis techniques to determine whether UC Berkeley can have in person instruction Fall 2021, with Lucie Chen, Samantha Tito, Jihee Choo


### My coursework has centered around stochastic processes, simulation, mathematical programming (linear, integer, mixed-integer), revenue management, and supply chains.

### I am also a grader for [IEOR 160](https://lavaei.ieor.berkeley.edu/Course_IEOR160_Spring_2022.html), a course on nonlinear and discrete optimization taught by Professor Javad Lavaei.
