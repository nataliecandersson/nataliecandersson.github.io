# Welcome!

## I am currently a student UC Berkeley studying [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR)(ieor.berkeley.edu) and Spanish. My research interests lie in matching markets and mechanism design for the public sector. I hope to pursue a Ph.D. in this field in the near future. 

### I have had the privilege to work on a few different research projects during my time at UC Berkeley. 

- [Optimizing Airline Overselling Using Simulation Optimization]



Move along.
