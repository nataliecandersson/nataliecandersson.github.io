### Welcome!

## I am currently a student UC Berkeley studying [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR)[(ieor.berkeley.edu)] and Spanish. My research interests lie in matching markets and mechanism design for the public sector. I hope to pursue a Ph.D. in this field in the near future. 




Move along.
