### I graduated in May 2022 with a Bachelors in [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR)](https://ieor.berkeley.edu) and a minor in [Spanish](https://spanish-portuguese.berkeley.edu/) from UC Berkeley. My research interests lie in engineering societal systems by tackling resource allocation problems aimed at the public sector. I like thinking about problems that have the opportunity to support marginalized communities. I am applying to Ph.D. programs in Fall 2022.

#### My current research focuses on optimizing the distribution of housing subsidy vouchers with Berkeley IEOR [Professor Zeyu Zheng](https://zheng.ieor.berkeley.edu/). We are applying concepts from revenue management and experiment design to streamline this process.

#### I am currently an Industrial Engineer at [Zoox](https://zoox.com), an autonomous vehicle company that was acquired by Amazon. I work on the logistics team and build models and tools to support the company's manufacturing, distribution, and supply chain initiatives. Previously, I was an intern at Zoox for the summer of 2021 and was an intern at [thredUP](https://thredup.com) for the summer of 2020.

#### During my time at UC Berkeley I had the privilege to work as a a grader for [IEOR 160](https://lavaei.ieor.berkeley.edu/Course_IEOR160_Spring_2022.html), a course on nonlinear and discrete optimization taught by [Professor Javad Lavaei](https://lavaei.ieor.berkeley.edu/index.html). 

#### Outside of school, I enjoy playing soccer, cross-country skiing, and running.
